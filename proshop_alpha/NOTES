HOMESCREEN 404 ERROR: PROJECTS NOT SHOWING

The reason the products were not showing on the homescreen and throwing you a 404 message
was that you forgot to set up the proxy server in the frontend package.json file. 

So the product data was located on the server at port 5000. But the frontend is listening on 
3000. 
Setting up the proxy server: 

"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"

right underneath "name" fixed the problem.

500 ERROR

In the root package json file, 

"type": "module"

underneath "main": "server.js"

fixed the problem.
